<h2 id="tutoring-computer-science-at-the-polytechnic-tutoring-center">Tutoring Computer Science at the Polytechnic Tutoring Center</h2>
<p><i style="color: #558cbd">Employment/Job</i></p>

<p>I’ve worked as a tutor at the 
<a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/tutoring-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PTC</a>
since Fall 2021. I tutor the introductory courses for computer science, 
which are Intro to Programming and Problem Solving, Data Structures &amp; 
Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>Tutoring at the PTC has allowed me to share my love of computer science 
in new ways. Through this experience, I have helped to guide students’ 
understanding of computer science. I have demonstrated how the field 
can be exciting by delving deeper into topics which a lecture may not 
have covered, and by doing so I have reinforced and grown my own 
understanding of my field. Tutoring has also allowed me to lead by 
making mock exam videos. Being a tutor has been very fulfilling, and it 
encourages my passion to share knowledge with those around me.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>Tutoring computer science directly relates to SDG 4: quality education. 
I have been able to help many students grasp content and understand 
their work at a deeper level. I believe this could also relate to the 
engineering challenge to advance personalized learning, as it is 
helping me find the best methods to teach for various students, and to 
recognize that not all students have the same needs.</p>

<h2 id="flexible-ai-enabled-mechatronic-systems-lab">Flexible AI-Enabled Mechatronic Systems Lab</h2>
<p><i style="color: #558cbd">Research/Lab Work</i>, 
<i style="color: #558cbd">Special Program</i></p>

<p>From Summer to Fall 2022, I was a member of the 
<a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/flexible-ai-enabled-mechatronic-systems-lab-fams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flexible AI-Enabled Mechatronic Systems</a> 
(FAMS) lab. The goal is to develop soft robots for commercial use, starting 
in the medical field. During this time, I was working on a solo project 
involving spatial awareness in robots, while in the contactless robots subteam.</p>

<center>
<img src="/assets/images/arm_camera.jpg" alt="The robot arm I assembled for telerobotics tasks, alongside a depth camera intended for visual self modeling" style="width: 40%;">
</center>

<h5 id="visual-self-modeling">Visual Self Modeling</h5>
<p>I worked on a new project, solo. The project was inspired by work from the 
<a href="https://www.creativemachineslab.com/visual-self-modeling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Machines Lab</a>, 
called visual self modeling. The premise is that robots can use machine 
learning to gain a “sense of self,” which is then able to be used to 
generalize movements to task-agnostic actions. This would mean a robot could 
control its movement closer to the way a human does, without needing 
controllers or having to think in terms of Jacobian matrices to move an arm 
to a precise point in space with a pre-planned path.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me-1">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This experience sparked new interests for me of robotics and, more 
specifically, the combination of robotics with artificial intelligence. 
Working with soft robotics and artificial intelligence together can give 
insights into natural intelligence, given that there are closer similarities 
than AI or robotics have apart. It can also provide benefits to the world with 
its applications in healthcare and the potential to perform complex technical 
tasks with greater ease than traditional robots. This promising field has 
inspired me to look further into robotics.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges-1">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>Soft robots are an innovative improvement over current robots when it comes to 
human interaction and less-specialized tasks. The development of soft robots 
has benefits in a variety of fields, including healthcare. Because of this, 
the FAMS lab contributes to good health and well-being (SDG 3), and industry, 
innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9). The goal of my project, specifically, 
was to look into visual self modeling. Part of the motivation for this is that 
people plan how to move based on an internal model of where they are in 
physical space; looking into how this is done could unlock some secrets of 
consciousness. This would relate to the NAE grand challenge of 
reverse-engineering the brain.</p>

<h2 id="research-in-vr">Research in VR</h2>
<p><i style="color: #558cbd">Research/Lab Work</i>, 
<i style="color: #558cbd">Special Program</i></p>

<p>In Summer 2022, I worked as an undergraduate researcher with Dzung Luong on 
the project “Education Metaverse,” the ultimate goal being to create an 
accessible education system through virtual reality. I co-developed a virtual 
reality form of a materials science lab, focusing on a tensile strength 
testing lesson. I implemented the functionality for the universal testing 
machine and started working on networking, though I was unable to finish. 
<a href="https://youtu.be/8SkQGt_Jkoc?si=a52_msFg1z5KdC97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The project</a> has since 
developed into a <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/vip-team/metaverse-education-gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertically Integrated Project</a>.</p>

</center>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me-2">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This project gave me more experience in the virtual reality realm. I learned 
ways to interact with VR differently than previous projects like the AIM Lab 
project. As the most experienced member of the team, I took on a leadership 
role in the beginning and worked with my teammates to make sure we were on 
track. While I struggled partly due to a lack of guidance from a professor 
switching research goals, I was able to learn from the experience and learn 
about how I work best.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges-2">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>This project would enhance quality education (SDG 4) by providing expensive 
equipment to a wider audience and making it interactive. It would also help to 
advance personalized learning. The ultimate goal, along with teaching, would 
be to improve the accessibility of a materials science laboratory. Because of 
this, industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) could also be 
considered as a long-term goal.</p>

<p>I spent a semester abroad in Abu Dhabi. I lived at 
<a href="https://www.nyu.edu/abu-dhabi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYU Abu Dhabi</a>, and I was able to explore 
the Emirates during my stay.</p>

<p>Being abroad helped me to experience another culture and set of values. I learned a lot about the UAE and the Middle East.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>I learned a lot about the UAE and the Middle East during this trip. It helped 
me to see the importance of learning about people’s backgrounds when working 
internationally. During my time here, I was able to see many diverse 
perspectives, and I was able to diversify my studies by looking into 
psychology more. This experience validates my stance that interactions outside 
of one’s own bubble are important.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>Being abroad helped me to experience another culture and set of values. I 
believe coming together through international experiences helps us to promote 
peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Keeping in touch 
with people across the globe means that someone will always be there for you. 
It also means there will be greater awareness of peaceful ties between nations.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-studies">Machine Learning Studies</h2>
<p><i style="color: #57068c">Special Course</i>, <i style="color: #57068c">Data Science/AI/Robotics</i></p>

<p>In Fall 2021, I took a course on AI. This gave me a broad overview on how 
artificial intelligence works, what people have tried, and what is changing 
now. It introduced me to different kinds of AI, and allowed me to build my own 
AIs to solve reasonably complex tasks.</p>

<p>In Spring 2023, I took a course on machine learning, where I co-developed 
classification models used to identify hand motion using brain waves. Here are links to 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMSdHr8s3K4ryfnxMM-Fql2VxHsUkxYkH87be4jBtlU/export?format=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the report</a> 
and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYA76V19QdXKDePGJbZYRyYKzOeLhjVB9hEBzevFWOU/export/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a>.</p>

<p>In Summer 2023, I took a course about AI and society, where I learned about 
the impacts of current AI technologies in society today.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This was a useful course to gain a base understanding of the field of AI as a 
whole. From here, I was able to look into where I could specialize to best aid 
my goal. Machine learning is a promising path, but it is not the only path 
forward; many AI tasks accomplish interesting subproblems that can be applied 
to other challenging areas, such as optimization of a computer architecture 
based on its most common operations. Also, this course helped me to find that 
I quite like building AIs, which validates my career decisions.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>Artificial Intelligence relates to the grand engineering challenge of 
reverse-engineering the brain. To do such a thing, it is useful to see what 
others have attempted in the past to create intelligence. Having a base 
knowledge of AI techniques also allowed me to consider how to augment some 
with biologically-inspired changes. For example, using neural networks as a 
simulation of the brain is not quite accurate; however, it is a good starting 
point, with room to add complexity such as interactions of nodes in a group. 
It also proposes certain challenges, such as whether one should simulate 
astrocytes in a simulation of neurons.</p>

<h2 id="aim-haptics-lab">AIM Haptics Lab</h2>
<p><i style="color: #57068c">Research/Lab Work</i>, <i style="color: #57068c">Emerging Media</i></p>

<p>In spring 2022, I helped to create a virtual reality classroom environment 
where a professor could interact with a student through touch. We wanted to 
achieve this using a prototype 
<a href="https://aimlab-haptics.com/affective-haptics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haptic jacket</a> 
created by the AIM lab. My contributions included rigging and setting up the 
human 3D model for use with the Kinect SDK, and designing human models using 
MakeHuman.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me-1">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This experience helped me to appreciate the effort that goes into a project 
that combines media, coding, and virtual reality with haptic feedback. Some of 
this difficulty came from the outdated technology we were using, and a lack of 
alternatives. I intend to work with more mixed reality SDKs that will 
hopefully be more compatible with the modern state of VR. I might also be 
inspired to work toward a better alternative for today for things such as the 
Kinect SDK.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges-1">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>This project has the potential to aid in advancing personalized learning. The 
goal is to allow students to interact with professors in a way that is not 
possible with traditional online courses. Students who do not get enough out 
of Zoom courses could be helped by a closer-to-in-person interaction, and in a 
live setting the instructor can gauge an audience response better than through 
a screen without camera participation. This project, if completed, could also 
enhance education quality (SDG 4), as another goal was to allow for recordings 
of the professor which the student could play back whenever they need.</p>

<h2 id="tandon-and-the-bowery-mission">Tandon and the Bowery Mission</h2>
<p><i style="color: #27a35d">Volunteer Event</i></p>

<p>I helped to assemble Practical Care Kits for the clients of 
<a href="https://www.bowery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bowery Mission</a>. These kits went toward the 
efforts to overcome homelessness and marginalization in New York. Each member 
of the event handled one portion of the kit in an assembly-line style. During 
this event, I was at the end of the line, and I helped by sealing and packing 
the kits. I also grabbed more boxes from across the street to place the kits 
in.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This event showed me that even taking an hour out of my day can make a huge 
impact for a lot of people. Coming together and working on this task was 
fairly easy once we had enough people to form an assembly-line-style kit 
creation method. That helped to show me the importance of teamwork during 
these events. It also showed me how everyone, no matter their role, 
contributes to the success of a project like this.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>The Practical Care Kits aid in the mission for good health and well-being (SDG 
3). It does so by providing health and hygiene kits to those who need it. This 
service also aims to reduce inequalities within the state. This is helped by 
providing these care kits to those who need it.</p>

<p><i style="color: #27a35d">Volunteer Event</i>, 
<i style="color: #27a35d">Sustainability</i></p>

<p>I participated in a volunteer event for Earth Day at [Fort Greene Park]
(https://www.fortgreenepark.org/) in Brooklyn. Activities at this event 
included plant, book, and clothing swaps; planting and creating seed bombs; 
and a number of other fun activities to involve the public in earth-friendly 
activities. An Earth Day event like this helps to promote sustainable 
activities. Trading items is a sustainable and community-building way to 
acquire new things.</p>

<p>I was stationed at the book swap table, where people would be able to pick up, 
drop off, or trade books. I helped to facilitate these swaps and keep the 
table organized.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me-1">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>I really enjoyed volunteering. I was able to assist people and direct the 
organization of the books. I felt my decisions mattered, and were helpful to 
the cause I was volunteering to support. I would like to contribute more to 
causes I support in this hands-on way. This experience showed me ways to 
interact with the community I hadn’t known about before. It showed me the 
importance of doing so as well.</p>

<h5 id="connection-to-un-sustainable-development-goalsgrand-challenges-1">Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges</h5>
<p>This event contributes to having a sustainable city and community (SDG 11). It 
does so by promoting sustainable activities such as planting and trading. 
Planting and similar activities can demonstrate to the city how important the 
environment is and how easy it can be to contribute. Trading items like 
clothes, plants, and books, is more sustainable and community-building than 
buying these items newly-produced.</p>

<p>In Fall 2022, I took the Podium Digital Marketing and Customer Acquisition 
courses. I attended live labs and built a website on Shopify using digital 
marketing techniques. I learned to work with a global audience in mind. See 
my site for a mock sunscreen company <a href="https://edw2290.myshopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="how-it-impacted-me">How it impacted me</h5>
<p>This course helped me see the world in a new light. Branding and marketing are 
all around us, and it would be advantageous to utilize it. I believe building 
a brand for myself will be an important part of advocating for my goals on a 
global level. The experience also showed me more ways that one’s world views 
can differ from my own, and ways to bridge those gaps and work with different

<p>The Global Tech experience is centered around providing modern skills to a 
wide audience of learners. It is for this reason that I believe the experience 
is connected to SDG 4, quality education. The experience also advocates for 
inclusion, and includes a series of lessons about handling interactions 
between different cultures within the workplace. This also connects to SDG 16: 
peace, justice and strong institutions.</p>
