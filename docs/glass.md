## About GLASS Projects
{: style="text-align: center"}
The projects for Tandon Honors students in the [Global Leaders & Scholars in STEM](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/glass){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} program consists of a culmination of various experiences, research, and interests related to the [Tandon Areas of Research Excellence](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Scholars are also required to address the [NAE Grand Challenges](https://www.nae.edu/20782/grand-challenges-project){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and think about the [United Nations Sustainability Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} when doing so. At the end of the 3 years in the GLASS Program, students have a better understanding of the impact they can have on changing the world for the better. GLASS students enter the world as globally competent and socially responsible innovators and engineers!

### Mission Statement
Neuroscience is an ever-evolving field that presents many opportunities to explore the brain through computer science and engineering: brain-computer interfaces, [3D-printed brain-like organoids](https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/researchers-bioprint-living-brain-cell-networks-in-the-lab){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, spatially-aware robots, and neuromorphic computing all present glimpses into our inner-workings.

Reverse-engineering the brain would provide many health benefits. We could reduce animal cruelty in drug testing, while achieving more accurate results of interactions. On the hardware side, we could reduce our energy output with brain-inspired systems.

With a background in computer science, mathematics, and robotics, I hope to provide a unique perspective to the field moving forward.
