## About GLASS Projects
{: style="text-align: center"}
The projects for Tandon Honors students in the [Global Leaders & Scholars in STEM](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/glass) program consists of a culmination of various experiences, research, and interests related to the [Tandon Areas of Research Excellence](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence). Scholars are also required to address the [NAE Grand Challenges](https://www.nae.edu/20782/grand-challenges-project) and think about the [United Nations Sustainability Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) when doing so. At the end of the 3 years in the GLASS Program, students have a better understanding of the impact they can have on changing the world for the better. GLASS students enter the world as globally competent and socially responsible innovators and engineers!

### Mission Statement
Neuroscience is an ever-evolving field that presents many opportunities to 
explore the brain through computer science and engineering: brain-computer 
interfaces, 
[3D-printed brain-like organoids](https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/researchers-bioprint-living-brain-cell-networks-in-the-lab), 
spatially-aware robots, and neuromorphic computing all present glimpses into 
our inner-workings. With a background in computer science, mathematics, and 
robotics, I hope to provide a unique perspective to the field moving forward.

This goal relates to the National Academy of Engineering's grand challenge of [reverse-engineering the brain](https://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges/9109.aspx). 
Reverse-engineering the brain would provide many health 
benefits. We could reduce animal cruelty in drug testing, while achieving more 
accurate results of interactions. On the hardware side, we could reduce our 
energy output with brain-inspired systems.

The goal also relates most closely to two of the Tandon School of 
Engineering's Areas of Excellence: [data science/AI/robotics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence/data-science-ai-robotics) 
and [health](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence/health)
