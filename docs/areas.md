### Areas of Excellence
- Which [Areas of Research Excellence](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence) does your mission statement relate to?
- Choose at least two areas of excellence and include the title and overview sentence
- Summarize how they relate to your mission statement

This section should be a broad connection/overview; think of it as an introduction to the areas of excellence.

Imagine you are explaining this to a general audience or non-experts/non-STEM personnel (ex. a younger cousin with no knowledge in these areas).

Do not list or explain any of your components in this section -- that will go into the [Experiences]() section.

### Final Paper
- Which [United Nations Sustainability Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) or [NAE Grand Challenges](https://www.nae.edu/20782/grand-challenges-project) does your mission statement connect to?
- Choose at least two. List them and provide a one-sentence explanation of what they are.
