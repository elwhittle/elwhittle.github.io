      ### Research in VR
      In Summer 2022, I co-developed a materials science lab prototype with a focus on the universal testing machine. [The project](https://youtu.be/8SkQGt_Jkoc?si=a52_msFg1z5KdC97) has since developed into a [Vertically Integrated Project](https://engineering.nyu.edu/vip-team/metaverse-education-gy).

      The goal is to create an accessible education system through virtual reality.

      ### Study Abroad in Abu Dhabi
      I explored the Emirates during a semester abroad [in Abu Dhabi](https://www.nyu.edu/abu-dhabi.html). 

      Being abroad helped me to experience another culture and set of values. I learned a lot about the UAE and the Middle East.

      ### Machine Learning Studies
      I have taken courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

      In Spring 2023, I co-developed classification models used to identify hand motion using brain waves. Here are links to [the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMSdHr8s3K4ryfnxMM-Fql2VxHsUkxYkH87be4jBtlU/export?format=pdf) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYA76V19QdXKDePGJbZYRyYKzOeLhjVB9hEBzevFWOU/export/pdf).

      In Summer 2023, I learned about the impacts of current AI technologies in society.

      ### Tandon and the Bowery Mission
      I helped to assemble Practical Care Kits for the clients of [The Bowery Mission](https://www.bowery.org/). 
    
      These kits went toward the efforts to overcome homelessness and marginalization in New York.      
      

      ### Earth Day at Fort Greene Park
      I participated in a volunteer event for Earth Day at [Fort Greene Park](https://www.fortgreenepark.org/) in Brooklyn. 
    
      I was stationed at the book swap table, where I organized the station's books and helped to facilitate swapping.
    
      An Earth Day event like this helps to promote sustainable activities. Trading items is a sustainable and community-building way to acquire new things.

      ### Tutoring Computer Science
      I tutor the introductory courses for computer science at my university: Intro to Programming in Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.

      I have helped students understand their studies at a deeper level while sharing my love of the subject.
