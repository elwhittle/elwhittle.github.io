### Hi! I'm El.

![El Whittle](/assets/images/el-coffee.jpg)

I'm an undergraduate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I'm majoring in computer science, with minors in robotics and math. I work as a software engineer for [Qiqochat](https://qiqochat.com/about){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I also work as a computer science tutor at the [Polytechnic Tutoring Center](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/tutoring-center){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I am interested in machine learning, the brain, neurorobotics, and programming languages.

I also like rock climbing, board games, and tabletop RPGs.

I try to keep track of what I've learned in my [digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/el-whittle/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
