### Hi! I'm El.

I'm an undergraduate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). I'm majoring in computer science, minoring in math. I work as a software engineer for [Insightflow](https://www.goinsightflow.com/). I am interested in machine learning, the brain, computational neuroscience and cognitive science, and programming languages and compilers.

I also like rock climbing, board games, and tabletop RPGs.

I try to keep track of what I've learned in my [digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/el-whittle/).
