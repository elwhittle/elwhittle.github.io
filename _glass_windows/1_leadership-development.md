### Research in VR
In Summer 2022, I co-developed a materials science lab prototype with a focus 
on the universal testing machine. 
[The project](https://youtu.be/8SkQGt_Jkoc?si=a52_msFg1z5KdC97) has since 
developed into a [Vertically Integrated Project](https://engineering.nyu.edu/vip-team/metaverse-education-gy).

The goal is to create an accessible education system through virtual reality.
