## Tutoring Computer Science at the Polytechnic Tutoring Center
<i style="color: #558cbd">Employment/Job</i>

I've worked as a tutor at the 
[PTC](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/tutoring-center)
since Fall 2021. I tutor the introductory courses for computer science, 
which are Intro to Programming and Problem Solving, Data Structures & 
Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.

##### How it impacted me
Tutoring at the PTC has allowed me to share my love of computer science 
in new ways. Through this experience, I have helped to guide studentsâ€™ 
understanding of computer science. I have demonstrated how the field 
can be exciting by delving deeper into topics which a lecture may not 
have covered, and by doing so I have reinforced and grown my own 
understanding of my field. Tutoring has also allowed me to lead by 
making mock exam videos. Being a tutor has been very fulfilling, and it 
encourages my passion to share knowledge with those around me.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
Tutoring computer science directly relates to SDG 4: quality education. 
I have been able to help many students grasp content and understand 
their work at a deeper level. I believe this could also relate to the 
engineering challenge to advance personalized learning, as it is 
helping me find the best methods to teach for various students, and to 
recognize that not all students have the same needs.

## Flexible AI-Enabled Mechatronic Systems Lab

<i style="color: #558cbd">Special Program</i>

From Summer to Fall 2022, I was a member of the 
[Flexible AI-Enabled Mechatronic Systems](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/flexible-ai-enabled-mechatronic-systems-lab-fams) 
(FAMS) lab. The goal is to develop soft robots for commercial use, starting 
in the medical field. During this time, I was working on a solo project 
involving spatial awareness in robots, while in the contactless robots subteam.

##### Visual Self Modeling
I worked on a new project, solo. The project was inspired by work from the 
[Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/visual-self-modeling.html), 
called visual self modeling. The premise is that robots can use machine 
learning to gain a "sense of self," which is then able to be used to 
generalize movements to task-agnostic actions. This would mean a robot could 
control its movement closer to the way a human does, without needing 
controllers or having to think in terms of Jacobian matrices to move an arm 
to a precise point in space with a pre-planned path.

##### How it impacted me
This experience sparked new interests for me of robotics and, more 
specifically, the combination of robotics with artificial intelligence. 
Working with soft robotics and artificial intelligence together can give 
insights into natural intelligence, given that there are closer similarities 
than AI or robotics have apart. It can also provide benefits to the world with 
its applications in healthcare and the potential to perform complex technical 
tasks with greater ease than traditional robots. This promising field has 
inspired me to look further into robotics.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
Soft robots are an innovative improvement over current robots when it comes to 
human interaction and less-specialized tasks. The development of soft robots 
has benefits in a variety of fields, including healthcare. Because of this, 
the FAMS lab contributes to good health and well-being (SDG 3), and industry, 
innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9). The goal of my project, specifically, 
was to look into visual self modeling. Part of the motivation for this is that 
people plan how to move based on an internal model of where they are in 
physical space; looking into how this is done could unlock some secrets of 
consciousness. This would relate to the NAE grand challenge of 
reverse-engineering the brain.

## Research in VR

In Summer 2022, I worked as an undergraduate researcher with Dzung Luong on 
the project "Education Metaverse," the ultimate goal being to create an 
accessible education system through virtual reality. I co-developed a virtual 
reality form of a materials science lab, focusing on a tensile strength 
testing lesson. I implemented the functionality for the universal testing 
machine and started working on networking, though I was unable to finish. 
[The project](https://youtu.be/8SkQGt_Jkoc?si=a52_msFg1z5KdC97) has since 
developed into a [Vertically Integrated Project](https://engineering.nyu.edu/vip-team/metaverse-education-gy).

</center>

##### How it impacted me
This project gave me more experience in the virtual reality realm. I learned 
ways to interact with VR differently than previous projects like the AIM Lab 
project. As the most experienced member of the team, I took on a leadership 
role in the beginning and worked with my teammates to make sure we were on 
track. While I struggled partly due to a lack of guidance from a professor 
switching research goals, I was able to learn from the experience and learn 
about how I work best.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
This project would enhance quality education (SDG 4) by providing expensive 
equipment to a wider audience and making it interactive. It would also help to 
advance personalized learning. The ultimate goal, along with teaching, would 
be to improve the accessibility of a materials science laboratory. Because of 
this, industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) could also be 
considered as a long-term goal.
