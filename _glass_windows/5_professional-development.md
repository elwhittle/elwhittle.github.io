## Podium Education: Digital Marketing Track
<i style="color: #eb633d">Special Course</i>

In Fall 2022, I took the Podium Digital Marketing and Customer Acquisition 
courses. I attended live labs and built a website on Shopify using digital 
marketing techniques. I learned to work with a global audience in mind. See 
my site for a mock sunscreen company [here](https://edw2290.myshopify.com/).

##### How it impacted me
This course helped me see the world in a new light. Branding and marketing are 
all around us, and it would be advantageous to utilize it. I believe building 
a brand for myself will be an important part of advocating for my goals on a 
global level. The experience also showed me more ways that oneâ€™s world views 
can differ from my own, and ways to bridge those gaps and work with different 
types of people.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
The Global Tech experience is centered around providing modern skills to a 
wide audience of learners. It is for this reason that I believe the experience 
is connected to SDG 4, quality education. The experience also advocates for 
inclusion, and includes a series of lessons about handling interactions 
between different cultures within the workplace. This also connects to SDG 16: 
peace, justice and strong institutions.
