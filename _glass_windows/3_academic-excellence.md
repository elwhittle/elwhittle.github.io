## Machine Learning Studies
<i style="color: #57068c">Special Course</i>, <i style="color: #57068c">Data Science/AI/Robotics</i>

In Fall 2021, I took a course on AI. This gave me a broad overview on how 
artificial intelligence works, what people have tried, and what is changing 
now. It introduced me to different kinds of AI, and allowed me to build my own 
AIs to solve reasonably complex tasks.

In Spring 2023, I took a course on machine learning, where I co-developed 
classification models used to identify hand motion using brain waves. Here are links to 
[the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMSdHr8s3K4ryfnxMM-Fql2VxHsUkxYkH87be4jBtlU/export?format=pdf) 
and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYA76V19QdXKDePGJbZYRyYKzOeLhjVB9hEBzevFWOU/export/pdf).

In Summer 2023, I took a course about AI and society, where I learned about 
the impacts of current AI technologies in society today.

##### How it impacted me
This was a useful course to gain a base understanding of the field of AI as a 
whole. From here, I was able to look into where I could specialize to best aid 
my goal. Machine learning is a promising path, but it is not the only path 
forward; many AI tasks accomplish interesting subproblems that can be applied 
to other challenging areas, such as optimization of a computer architecture 
based on its most common operations. Also, this course helped me to find that 
I quite like building AIs, which validates my career decisions.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
Artificial Intelligence relates to the grand engineering challenge of 
reverse-engineering the brain. To do such a thing, it is useful to see what 
others have attempted in the past to create intelligence. Having a base 
knowledge of AI techniques also allowed me to consider how to augment some 
with biologically-inspired changes. For example, using neural networks as a 
simulation of the brain is not quite accurate; however, it is a good starting 
point, with room to add complexity such as interactions of nodes in a group. 
It also proposes certain challenges, such as whether one should simulate 
astrocytes in a simulation of neurons.

## AIM Haptics Lab

In spring 2022, I helped to create a virtual reality classroom environment 
where a professor could interact with a student through touch. We wanted to 
achieve this using a prototype 
[haptic jacket](https://aimlab-haptics.com/affective-haptics) 
created by the AIM lab. My contributions included rigging and setting up the 
human 3D model for use with the Kinect SDK, and designing human models using 
MakeHuman.

##### How it impacted me
This experience helped me to appreciate the effort that goes into a project 
that combines media, coding, and virtual reality with haptic feedback. Some of 
this difficulty came from the outdated technology we were using, and a lack of 
alternatives. I intend to work with more mixed reality SDKs that will 
hopefully be more compatible with the modern state of VR. I might also be 
inspired to work toward a better alternative for today for things such as the 
Kinect SDK.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
This project has the potential to aid in advancing personalized learning. The 
goal is to allow students to interact with professors in a way that is not 
possible with traditional online courses. Students who do not get enough out 
of Zoom courses could be helped by a closer-to-in-person interaction, and in a 
live setting the instructor can gauge an audience response better than through 
a screen without camera participation. This project, if completed, could also 
enhance education quality (SDG 4), as another goal was to allow for recordings 
of the professor which the student could play back whenever they need.
