### Machine Learning Studies
I have taken courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

In Spring 2023, I co-developed classification models used to identify hand motion using brain waves. Here are links to [the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMSdHr8s3K4ryfnxMM-Fql2VxHsUkxYkH87be4jBtlU/export?format=pdf) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYA76V19QdXKDePGJbZYRyYKzOeLhjVB9hEBzevFWOU/export/pdf).

In Summer 2023, I learned about the impacts of current AI technologies in society.
