## Tandon and the Bowery Mission
<i style="color: #3deb88">Volunteer Event</i>

I helped to assemble Practical Care Kits for the clients of 
[The Bowery Mission](https://www.bowery.org/). These kits went toward the 
efforts to overcome homelessness and marginalization in New York. Each member 
of the event handled one portion of the kit in an assembly-line style. During 
this event, I was at the end of the line, and I helped by sealing and packing 
the kits. I also grabbed more boxes from across the street to place the kits 
in.

##### How it impacted me
This event showed me that even taking an hour out of my day can make a huge 
impact for a lot of people. Coming together and working on this task was 
fairly easy once we had enough people to form an assembly-line-style kit 
creation method. That helped to show me the importance of teamwork during 
these events. It also showed me how everyone, no matter their role, 
contributes to the success of a project like this.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
The Practical Care Kits aid in the mission for good health and well-being (SDG 
3). It does so by providing health and hygiene kits to those who need it. This 
service also aims to reduce inequalities within the state. This is helped by 
providing these care kits to those who need it.

### Earth Day at Fort Greene Park

<i style="color: #3deb88">Sustainability</i>

I participated in a volunteer event for Earth Day at [Fort Greene Park]
(https://www.fortgreenepark.org/) in Brooklyn. Activities at this event 
included plant, book, and clothing swaps; planting and creating seed bombs; 
and a number of other fun activities to involve the public in earth-friendly 
activities. An Earth Day event like this helps to promote sustainable 
activities. Trading items is a sustainable and community-building way to 
acquire new things.

I was stationed at the book swap table, where people would be able to pick up, 
drop off, or trade books. I helped to facilitate these swaps and keep the 
table organized.

##### How it impacted me
I really enjoyed volunteering. I was able to assist people and direct the 
organization of the books. I felt my decisions mattered, and were helpful to 
the cause I was volunteering to support. I would like to contribute more to 
causes I support in this hands-on way. This experience showed me ways to 
interact with the community I hadnâ€™t known about before. It showed me the 
importance of doing so as well.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
This event contributes to having a sustainable city and community (SDG 11). It 
does so by promoting sustainable activities such as planting and trading. 
Planting and similar activities can demonstrate to the city how important the 
environment is and how easy it can be to contribute. Trading items like 
clothes, plants, and books, is more sustainable and community-building than 
buying these items newly-produced.
