### Tandon and the Bowery Mission
I helped to assemble Practical Care Kits for the clients of [The Bowery Mission](https://www.bowery.org/). 

These kits went toward the efforts to overcome homelessness and marginalization in New York.      


### Earth Day at Fort Greene Park
I participated in a volunteer event for Earth Day at [Fort Greene Park](https://www.fortgreenepark.org/) in Brooklyn. 

I was stationed at the book swap table, where I organized the station's books and helped to facilitate swapping.

An Earth Day event like this helps to promote sustainable activities. Trading items is a sustainable and community-building way to acquire new things.
