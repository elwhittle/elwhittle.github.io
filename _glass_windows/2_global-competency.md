## Study Abroad in Abu Dhabi
I spent a semester abroad in Abu Dhabi. I lived at 
[NYU Abu Dhabi](https://www.nyu.edu/abu-dhabi.html), and I was able to explore 
the Emirates during my stay.


Being abroad helped me to experience another culture and set of values. I learned a lot about the UAE and the Middle East.

##### How it impacted me
I learned a lot about the UAE and the Middle East during this trip. It helped 
me to see the importance of learning about people’s backgrounds when working 
internationally. During my time here, I was able to see many diverse 
perspectives, and I was able to diversify my studies by looking into 
psychology more. This experience validates my stance that interactions outside 
of one’s own bubble are important.

##### Connection to UN Sustainable Development Goals/Grand Challenges
Being abroad helped me to experience another culture and set of values. I 
believe coming together through international experiences helps us to promote 
peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Keeping in touch 
with people across the globe means that someone will always be there for you. 
It also means there will be greater awareness of peaceful ties between nations.
